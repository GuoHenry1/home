			Romance animes are generally set in high school. They involve a slow plot with a bit of comedy to make it more entertaining. The best part about these ones are the endings, they make you feel a mix of emotions and are one of the reasons that this genre is popular. Your Lie in April for example has a heartbreaking ending involving a note of one of the dead characters.
