			Comedy anime is my personal favorite and are made just to make you laugh. The hall of fame for comedy
			consists of
		</p>
		<ul class="p">
			<li>Nichijoiu or My Ordinary Life</li>
			<li>One Punch Man</li>
			<li>Konosuba!</li>
		</ul>
		<p class="p">
			Comedy anime is sort of a hit or a miss. It can be incredibly funny and sometimes it just sucks. 
			This type of anime doesn't require any commitments and can be watched as just a casual thing. They 
			generally revolve around another plot with comedy just being an added feature, but sometimes you have animes
			devoted to comedy such as Nichijou. It's about a couple of girls in high school and the hilarity that surrounds 
			them.

		<h1 class="h1">Fantasy!</h1>
		<hr class="hr2">
		<img src="images/fantasy1.jpg" id="fantasy1" title="Re:zero" alt="Re:Zero">
		<p class="p">
			Fantasy anime is for those people that like to think of the world as fake and wish to live in another.
			That's the basic plot of every fantasy anime.
		</p>
		<ul id="ul">
			<li>Re:Zero</li>
			<li>Fate Stay/Night</li>
			<li>Fate Zero</li>
		</ul>
		<p class="p">
			Fantasy anime tells alot about worlds seperate from ours. It brings you on an adventure and fully immerse you
			in the story and the characters of the other world. They generally involve some sort of royal government with the 
			main character somehow ending up tangled in it.
