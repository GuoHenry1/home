			Slice of life anime can be very boring at times. The anime gives you exactly what it says, a slice of life. It gives a very realistic outlook on life. Although there are many situations where the situation is fake. It gives you a clue to as how people would act in a certain scenario. Anohana is about the ghost of a girl who comes back and wishes for her old comrades to come back together after breaking up due to her death.

			Sports animes are the most exciting thing you'll watch. They have you on the edge of your seat every minute!

			Sports animes are generally over dramatized. They are very intense and are loveable. There is alot of action and they push reality to the limit. In Haikyuu they make the real volleyball rules and push it too the limit. They make it look insane, but make it sound realistic. It gives alot of hope and happiness when the protaganists win. Haikyuu is a great example of this as it shows the growth of a small volleyball team get better and win games!
